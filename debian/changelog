  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * describe package build process
  * updated Cargo.toml
  * Update README.rst
  * update installation instructions
  * reformatting source
  * add some error messages
  * remove unnecessary variable
  * refactoring to use more Results
  * refactoring to remove unused variables
    the match has been unecessary
  * additional error messages

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Use containerized Travis build.
    Let's see if we get newer GTK packages there
  * Replace hard-coded UI by Glade designed XML
  * Use non-containerized Trusty in Travis build.
    This reverts commit aa9d7ce7ddd5f30076bf959b092ded9bc360acb7.
  * Another shot at a containerized Travis build
    using pre-compiled GTK binaries like they do in gtk-rs.
    This reverts commit 608858bc523d357e5e08d14199bccaddff4b022f.

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * lower dependencey to GTK 3.14 (tracking Debian stable)

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Completions can be selected from a list
  * Remove feature for using Entry instead of SearchEntry

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * ignore errors in completion commands

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Factor out creation and reading of config directory
  * Apply CSS styling if it exists
    under ~/.config/rrun/style.css
  * Create and use external Glade UI file
    under ~/.config/rrun/rrun.glade
  * Listen for key releases to handle backspace properly

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * complete entry field on tab

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Pressing TAB stays in input box and cycles through completions in list
  * Completion list only appears when there are completions

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * complete on key press instead of key release
    makes pressing TAB much more convenient..
  * show only 5 completions at once
    showing a mostly empty list of 20 entries fills up my screen
    unnecessarily, i think 5 is much nicer..
  * wrap the completion list in a scrollable list
  * revert change to key press event.
    When we trigger on key_release, the edit box is not yet updated and the
    completion will read the text from the previous completion -> so the
    completion list always lacks behind one character
  * revert key_release event
    when triggering on key_release, the edit box is not yet filled with the
    new character and the completion will be the last one.
    Need to find a better solution here
  * update Cargo.lock

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Revert order of completions, first id then text.
    We always need an id, so it should be the first argument.
    The following arguments then are optional and can later be used to include e.g. icons or longer descriptions

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * Revert "revert key_release event"
    This reverts commit 38bca006482238912fe83eaf4f8ef31dff5439ab.

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Query and print completions to stdout
  * Allow multiple match groups in regexes
  * Add cache command completion

  * UNRELEASED

  [ Martin Mauch ]

  [ Tshepang Lekhonkhobe ]
  * README: typo

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * begin work on ac_manager
  * update for new rust versions and dependencies.
    Let's see what travis says nowadays to gtk 3.16
  * revert to old travis setup

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Update dependencies to make build work
  * Replace class mutation with Iterator

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * add test for 'wh' which should find something starting with 'wh'
  * remove unused variable
  * fix bashgen usage
    bashgen returns the best match on the last line, so the vector needs to
    be reversed
  * reformatting sourcecode with rustfmt
    and adding rustfmt.toml

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Only call completion when TAB is pressed

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * remove unused dependencies
  * fix some clippy complaints

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Completions can be configured via .toml file
    located in ~/.config/rrun/config.toml

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * panic when not able to create config directory
  * don't panic on initial start
  * move GTK
  * silence debug output and give feedback about config file
  * read config file in get_config_file()
  * move creation of completers to function
  * panic when $HOME is not found
  * created contributors section
  * Update README.rst

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Runners can be configured via .toml file
    located in ~/.config/rrun/config.toml
  * Issuing a command without hitting TAB performs completion
  * Completion can specify a trigger that determines its applicability
  * Move running of completions into a closure and run by id
  * External completers can specify an id after a TAB
  * More debug info
  * Fix running of completions to use currently selected completion
  * Move completion and running logic into new Engine trait
  * Add completion and runner for numeric expressions to config
  * fixup! Completions can be configured via .toml file
  * Add completion for Google search and Chrome runner
  * Sort and uniq bash completions

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * removed "echo" completion
    if this is configured, completion only works on the second TAB as expected
  * I actually have chromium, and not google-chrome
    plus i am using dwb (which is x-www-browser) and others might use
    firefox..
    I think on linux "x-www-browser" is the standard way to do this
  * replaced ruby with python for general purpose scripts
    i think all major distributions come with python in the base
    installation, but not ruby. Users might not have ruby,
    so it looks like using python (or even perl, ugh..) would be better
  * add error message
  * output completion in debug
  * update Cargo.lock
  * debug output if cmd runs in background
  * run commands in background unless CTRL is pressed
  * fix url completion for google search
  * Update changelog for 0.0.7 release
